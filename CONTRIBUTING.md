Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at <https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/issues>.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

`thermoextrap` could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official `thermoextrap` docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
<https://github.com/usnistgov/thermoextrap/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
  welcome :)

This project uses a host of tools to (hopefully) make development easier. We
recommend installing some of these tools system wide. For this, we recommend
using either [pipx] or [condax]. We mostly use conda/condax, but the choice is
yours. For conda, we recommend actually using [mamba]. Alternatively, you can
setup `conda` to use the faster `mamba` solver. See [here][conda-fast-setup] for
details.

Additional tools are:

- [pre-commit]
- [tox] and [tox-conda]
- [cruft]
- [conda-merge]
- [scriv]

These are setup using the following:

```console
condax install pre-commit
condax install tox
condax inject tox tox-conda
condax install cruft
condax install conda-merge
condax install commitizen
pipx install scriv
```

Alternatively, you can install these dependencies using:

```console
conda env update -n {env-name} environment/tools.yaml
```

### Getting the repo

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `thermoextrap` for local development.

- Fork the `thermoextrap` repo on GitHub.

- Clone your fork locally:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/thermoextrap.git
  ```

  If the repo includes submodules, you can add them either with the initial
  close using:

  ```bash
  git clone --recursive-submodules git@github.com:your_name_here/thermoextrap.git
  ```

  or after the clone using

  ```bash
  cd thermoextrap
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

- Create development environment. There are two options to create the
  development environment.

  - The recommended method is to use tox by using either:

    ```bash
    tox -e dev
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    make dev-env
    ```

    These create a development environment located at `.tox/dev`.

    ```bash
    make tox-ipykernel-display-name
    ```

    This will add a meaningful display name for the kernel (assuming you're
    using [nb_conda_kernels])

  - Alternativley, you can create centrally located conda environmentment using
    the command:

    ```bash
    make mamba-dev
    ```

    This will create a conda environment 'thermoextrap-env' in the default
    location.

    To install (an editable version) of the current package:

    ```bash
    pip install -e . --no-deps
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    make install-dev
    ```

- Initiate [pre-commit] with:

  ```bash
  pre-commit install
  ```

  To update the recipe, periodically run:

  ```bash
  pre-commit autoupdate
  ```

  If recipes change over time, you can clean up old installs with:

  ```bash
  pre-commit gc
  ```

- Create a branch for local development:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
  ```

  Now you can make your changes locally. Alternatively, we recommend using
  [git-flow].

- When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the pre-commit
  checks: tests.

  ```bash
  pre-commit run [--all-files]
  ```

  To run tests, use:

  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

  To test against multiple python versions, use tox:

  ```bash
  tox
  ```

  or using the `make`:

  ```bash
  make test-all
  ```

  Additionally, you should run the following:

  ```bash
  make pre-commit-lint-markdown
  make pre-commit-codespell
  ```

- Create changelog fragment. See [scriv] for more info.

  ```bash
  scriv create --edit
  ```

- Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
  git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
  ```

  Note that the pre-commit hooks will force the commit message to be in the
  [conventional sytle][conventional-style]. To assist this, you may want to
  commit using [commitizen].

  ```bash
  cz commit
  ```

- Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

### Dependency management

Dependencies need to be placed in a few locations, which depend on the nature of
the dependency.

- Package dependency: `environment.yaml` and `dependencies` section of
  `pyproject.toml`
- Documentation dependency: `environment/docs-extras.yaml` and `test` section of
  `pyproject.toml`
- Development dependency: `environment/dev-extras.yaml` and `dev` section of
  `pyproject.toml`

Note that total yaml files are build using [conda-merge]. For example,
`environment.yaml` is combined with `environment/docs-extras.yaml` to produce
`environment/docs.yaml`. This is automated in the `Makefile`. You can also run,
after doing any updates,

```bash
make environment-files-build
```

which will rebuild all the needed yaml files.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

- The pull request should include tests.
- If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your
  new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the
  list in CHANGELOG.md. You should use [scriv] for this.
- The pull request should work for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.

## Building the docs

We use [tox] to isolate the documentation build. Useful commands are as follows.

- Build the docs:

  ```bash
  tox -e docs -- build
  ```

- Spellcheck the docs:

  ```bash
  tox -e docs -- spelling
  ```

- Create a release of the docs:

  ```bash
  tox -e docs -- release
  ```

  If you make any changes to `docs/examples`, you should run:

  ```bash
  make docs-examples-symlink
  ```

  to update symlinks from `docs/examples` to `examples`.

  After this, the docs can be pushed to the correct branch for distribution.

- Live documentation updates using

  ```bash
  make docs-livehtml
  ```

## Using tox

The package is setup to use tox to test, build and release pip and conda
distributions, and release the docs. Most of these tasks have a command in the
`Makefile`. To test against multiple versions, use:

```bash
make test-all
```

To build the documentation in an isolated environment, use:

```bash
make docs-build
```

To release the documentation use:

```bash
make docs-release release_args='-m "commit message" -r origin -p'
```

Where posargs is are passed to ghp-import. Note that the branch created is
called `nist-pages`. This can be changed in `tox.ini`.

To build the distribution, use:

```bash
make dist-pypi-[build-testrelease-release]
```

where `build` build to distro, `testrelease` tests putting on `testpypi` and
release puts the distro on pypi.

To build the conda distribution, use:

```bash
make dist-conda-[recipe, build]
```

where `recipe` makes the conda recipe (using grayskull), and `build` makes the
distro. This can be manually added to a channel.

To test the created distributions, you can use one of:

```bash
tox -e test-dist-[pypi, conda]-[local,remote]-py[38,39,...]
```

or

```bash
make test-dist-[pypi, conda]-[local,remote] py=[38, 39, 310]
```

where one options in the brackets should be choosen.

## Package version

[setuptools_scm]: https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm

Versioning is handled with [setuptools_scm].The pacakge version is set by the
git tag. For convenience, you can override the version in the makefile (calling
tox) by setting `version=v{major}.{minor}.{micro}`. This is useful for updating
the docs, etc.
