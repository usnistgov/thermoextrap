# This file is an example for setting user specific config
# for use with nox.  Copy this file to `config/userconfig.toml` in the
# root of the repo.  The file `config/userconfig.toml` should NOT be tracked.
#
# This file can also be created using
#
# python tools/projectconfig.py -p {pattern1, ...} -d {extra1, extras2, ...}
#
# This should point to (globbed version) of location of python executables
# For example, this could be paths = ["~/miniforge3/envs/test-3.*/bin"]
#
# [nox.python]
# paths = ["~/.conda/envs/test-3.*/bin"]
# Extras for environments
# for example, could have
#
# [nox.extras]
# dev = ["dev", "nox", "tools"]
